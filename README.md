 # Krish's Football-GM-v1.2 
This is a text-based game where you act as the general manager (GM) of an American football team. This game is similar to MADDEN, specifically the Franchise mode. 
You will be given a roster of 3 offensive players, a Quarterback (QB), Runningback (RB), Wide Receiver (WR), and 3 defensive players, an Edge Rusher (EDGE), Line-backer (LB), and Cornerback (CB). 
Each of these players has their own unique skill rating (ovr) that contributes to the ovr of their side (offensive ovr and defensive ovr). Together, these skill ratings make up your team's ovr, which is effectively a measure of how good your team is. If your team has a higher ovr, you are more likely to win games. You increase your team's overall by drafting new players each year and/or by signing players in free agency every year. Players also have an age which increases every year and affects their ovr. 
The goal of the game is to win the Super Bowl, which in American football occurs at the end of the single-elimination playoffs. To make the playoffs, you must win a certain amount of games in the regular season. Thus, your team should be good enough to consistently win in the regular season in order to have the best chance of winning the Super Bowl. 
When you are done playing at the end of a season, type "STOP" and you will see a small credits paragraph as well as a table showing your results, season by season. The table will also have some session-long results at the end, including total wins and losses, playoff appearances, Super Bowl wins, and more.

CHANGELOG:

v1.0 (6/15/23): Initial launch

v1.1 (10/15/23): 
-Added player aging and developing, made it so that as players age to their prime, they increase a random amount of ovr. After their prime and as they get older, they lose a random amount of ovr. These amounts ramp up depending on how close/far they are from their prime. 

v1.2 (1/30/24): 
-Added contracts and salary cap. Users now have to manage their players' salaries to ensure they stay under the salary cap. Players will also request new contracts every four seasons, with salaries corresponding to their overall, age, and position. 
-Changed Regular Season and Playoff schedule to better reflect the NFL (user's team plays teams in its division twice and plays teams in the conference in the playoff before playing the Superbowl against a team in the opposing conference).
